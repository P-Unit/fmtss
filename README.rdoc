To start the app from Cloud9 UI (user interface) run the following command in
the terminal (bottom of the UI):

rails s -p $PORT -b $IP                                                                                                                                                                                   

To stop the app, make sure you're in the Terminal portion of the UI and then
hit CTRL-C. (the control button and the "C" key simultaneously).
